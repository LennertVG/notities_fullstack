(The 4 stages of computational thinking)</h1>

<h2 id="decomposition-is-the-most-important-stage">Decomposition is the most important stage</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand the Requirements:</strong> Begin by thoroughly understanding the requirements of the application. Talk to stakeholders (clients) and gather detailed information on what the application should do or should be used for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify High-Level Components:</strong> Identify the high-level components or modules that are required to fulfill the application’s requirements. For instance, in a web application, you might have user authentication, database handling, front-end interfaces, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Break Down Components:</strong> For each high-level component, break it down further into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, if you have a user authentication component, you might have tasks like user registration, login, password reset, and session management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Define Backlog Items:</strong> Create a backlog for your project. Backlog items are essentially tasks or user stories that represent specific work to be done. Each backlog item should be small enough to be completed in a reasonable amount of time, typically a few days to a couple of weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritize Backlog Items:</strong> Once you have a list of backlog items, prioritize them based on factors like business value, dependencies, and risk. This helps you decide which tasks to tackle first.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-far...-euh...-how-deep-should-we-go">How far… euh… how deep should we go?</h2>
<p>How far/deep you should go in dividing the problem into backlog items depends on several factors, including the size and complexity of the project, your team’s capacity, and the project timeline. It’s important to strike a balance between granularity (smaller backlog items for better tracking) and practicality (items that can be completed within a reasonable timeframe). Regularly reviewing and adapting your backlog based on progress and feedback is key to succes.</p>

<h2 id="parallel--sequential">Parallel &amp; Sequential</h2>
<p>In our context as a developer, we encounter decomposition when optimizing code or designing complex applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parallel Decomposition</strong>: If you’re dealing with tasks that can be executed independently in a web application, you might use parallel decomposition to improve performance. For example, handling multiple user requests concurrently or processing data from different sources in parallel.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Image Processing in Parallel</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine you’re working on a web application that allows users to upload and edit images. When applying various filters like brightness, contrast, and color adjustments, you can use parallel decomposition.</li>
<li>Each filter operation can be applied independently to different sections of the image in parallel, leveraging the full processing power of multi-core processors to enhance the user experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>E-commerce Inventory Management</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In an e-commerce platform, managing product inventory efficiently is crucial. You can use parallel decomposition to track product availability.</li>
<li>Each product’s inventory status can be updated concurrently, with separate threads or processes responsible for different product categories or warehouses, ensuring real-time inventory updates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sequential Decomposition</strong>: In cases where certain operations must be performed in a specific order, like a step-by-step user registration process, you would use sequential decomposition to ensure that each step is completed before moving to the next.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>User Onboarding Flow</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In web development, creating a user-friendly onboarding flow is essential. Sequential decomposition is useful here.</li>
<li>The user registration process can be divided into sequential steps: inputting personal details, verifying email, setting up a profile picture, and completing the profile. Each step depends on the successful completion of the previous one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Order Checkout Process</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider an e-commerce website’s order checkout process. Sequential decomposition ensures a smooth user experience.</li>
<li>The checkout process typically includes steps like adding items to the cart, entering shipping details, selecting payment methods, and confirming the order. Each step follows the previous one in a predefined sequence, ensuring an orderly and error-free transaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
