ZIE OOK HTML IN TEAMS!
(why HTML? => Markdown Language (zie ook begrippen))
1) Decomposition
	- Breaking a problem down into smaller more manageable parts
2) Abstraction
	- Remove unnecessary details => Only Main, important points remain
3) Pattern Recognition
	- find similarities among small problems (efficiency)
4) Algorithm
	- Step-by-step instructions on how to solve problem

1) Decomposition
	1) Understand requirements
	2) Identify High-level components
		1) what needs to be done?
	3) Break Down Components
		1) What are the sub-tasks?
	4) Define Backlog Items
		1) smaller tasks (small enough to complete in reasonable amount of time)
	-  Keep in mind team capacity, timeline, etc...
	- Two kinds of decomposition
		- Parallel (volgorde is niet belangrijk)
		- Sequential (volgorde is belangrijk)
